Quick starting demo about Android Studio with Java to create a simple application.

Please refer to my full PDF file **"Android-Studio-Java-Intro"** for the full details, explanations, and resources.

## NOTES:
- To access the main java file:
    - app => src => main => java/com/example/myapplication => MainActivity.java
- To access the XML file:
    - app => src => main => res => layout => activity_main.xml
